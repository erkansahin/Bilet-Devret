# Bilet Devret
 
Suppose you want to go to a concert. It appears that all the tickets are sold out; so, you won't be able to go to the event. With our platform, you can look for posts on Bilet Devret and buy the ticket from someone who is not able to go to the event. In this way, you can buy a ticket that you normally cannot buy.

In another scenario, you have a ticket for a football match. Suppose, you do not want to go to the event as you have an emergency on the match day. If you do not go to the match, all the money you pay for the ticket goes for nothing. You do not want it to happen. You put a post on our app. You receive offers from several people and give the ticket to the highest bidder.

Our app is under development. We want to enhance our platform in light of the recommendations and complaints you convey to us!
